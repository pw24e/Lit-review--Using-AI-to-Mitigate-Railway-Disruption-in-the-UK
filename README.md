## 📝 Project Description

This repository contains a literature review conducted by reviewing ~130 academic and giverned resouces, imcluding peer reviewed journals and technical reports, focused on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to mitigate railway disruption in the United Kingdom. It was completed as part of assessed coursework for the MSc in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Liverpool.

## 🚆 Context and Focus

Railway disruptions in the UK, frequently caused by signal failures, point faults, and infrastructure fatigue, weather conditions, represent a persistent challenge to operators. This review explores:

- Key themes seen in the issues of the UK railway system
- How AI technologies are being used to detect, predict, and respond to railway disruptions  
- The effectiveness and limitations of current AI solutions  
- Challenges in real-world deployment and system integration

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Categorization of key issues seen in the UK Railway system
- Anomaly detection in signalling and switching systems  
- Predictive maintenance using machine learning algorithms  
- Computer vision for real-time asset monitoring  
- Applications of CNNs, SVMs, RNNs, and clustering approaches  
- Data limitations and interpretability issues in safety-critical environments  
- Implementation challenges such as data availability and real-time inference  

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- Reviewed ~130 academic and official sources, including peer-reviewed journals, government reports, and technical   
  publications  
- Categorized findings across detection, prediction, and prevention domains  
- Evaluated and compared model types, performance, and real-world applicability  
- Highlighted key gaps in generalizability and safety assurance
